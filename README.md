Here are the files you'll need to either make a Visual Studio project without building SFML yourself or extra files needed to build SFML 2.5.1 yourself (ARM and ARM64, x86 is not included).
More info on how to do both of these things can be found here: https://zombieschannel.itch.io/sfml-for-android-on-windows-using-visual-studio
